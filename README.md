## Features
* __Current__: Create and send website annotations over Matrix.
* __Current__: Store data in a decentralized and federated manner.
* __Current__: Share highlights with other users, including those on other servers.
* __Current__: Group annotations together and create multiple annotation groups
* __Planned__: Use Matrix's End-to-End encryption to ensure the secure transmission and storage of highlight data.
* __Planned__: Leverage the new [`m.thread` MSC](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/gsouquet/threading-via-relations/proposals/3440-threading-via-relations.md) to allow users to comment on and discuss
highlights.
* __Planned__: Use something like [ArchiveBox](https://archivebox.io/) to cache the current version of a website and prevent annotations from breaking.
* __Planned__ Highlight PDFs in addition to web pages.

Also check out [Populus](https://github.com/opentower/populus-viewer), which is a tool in similar spirit, but with a focus on annotating files.

## Building
The project is a handful of React applications written in TypeScript. It's sufficient to run:

```Bash
yarn install
yarn webpack
```

An (unpacked) extension will be available in `dist/`. Then, you can follow the [Google guide] to
install the unpacked extension in Chrome or Chromium.
